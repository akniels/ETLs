# ETLs

The Jupyter notebooks in the file show examples of how to build and ETL pipleine for disaster response datasets. The [ETL Pipeline](https://github.com/akniels/ETLs/blob/master/ETL%20Pipeline%20Preparation.ipynb) builds the model and stores the model in a database. The [ML Pipeline](https://github.com/akniels/ETLs/blob/master/ML%20Pipeline%20Preparation.ipynb) takes the data and stores that data into into a model for machine learning.
